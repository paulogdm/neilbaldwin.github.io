<h4>Make Sound, Quick!</h4>
<p>In addition to the quick-start text file included in the release package, I thought I could show you a quick and dirty way to make Nijuu make some noise so you'll at least know it's working.</p>
<p>With the template files copied, named with the name of your choice (and don't forget to edit the SONG_NAME variable in the .NIJ file), open up the .SNG file in a plain-text editor.</p>
<p>Scroll down to where you see the sequence named &quot;S1&quot; (it says &quot;Blank sequence for Drums&quot; just above it).</p>
<p>Go down to the line that reads &quot;db 0&quot; and change this to &quot;db 1,2,1,2&quot;.</p>
<p>Save the file.</p>
<p>Go to the command line/shell as described in the readme.txt file and compile the song as instructed.</p>
<p>Open the .NES or .NSF file, depending on what you built.</p>
<p>It should be playing a simple kick/snare drum pattern.</p>
<p>Read the manual, carefully. :)</p>
