<h2>Nijuu?</h2>
<p>&quot;Nijuu&quot; is a music engine for the NES written by me, Neil Baldwin.</p>
<h1>Website</h1>
<p>I decided to give Nijuu it's own spin-off from my other website so that I can develop this as a dedicated resource.</p>
<p>Initially you'll be able to download Nijuu and the documentation. Eventually I hope to add tutorials and help but I think the best steering for this should come from the potential users. Having said that I plan on a &quot;Tips and Tricks&quot; section for the curious and advanced people. </p>
<h1>Usage </h1>
<p>You're free to use Nijuu however you like, free of charge. Just be cool about it and don't do anything dirty like trying to sell it to others or claim it to be your own work.</p>
<p>I will try to help you if and when I can: I'm a busy chap though so some patience and perhaps another pass at the (extensive) manual is always recommended.</p>
