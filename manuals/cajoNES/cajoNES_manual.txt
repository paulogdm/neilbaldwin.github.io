"cajoNES- the NES drummer" by Neil Baldwin
-----------------------------------------

Here we go again!

"cajoNES" is a 16-step, 4 voice drum synthesiser for the NES. It has:

- ultra high-speed synthesis for sounds like you done never heard
- tempo control
- swing control
- repeat control on each step
- 'next step' control for non-linear playback and pattern length control
- randomise single cells, selected cells or whole steps
- copy-n-paste of cells
- no saving whatsoever!

SEE
  Down the left side are the Step Numbers
  Each horizontal step is made up of 14 parameters
  Across the top are the synthesis parameter IDs, see below for explanation
  At the bottom is the Speed, Swing amount and mute status for each voice

PLAY
  + Tap [START] to toggle play/pause
  + Hold [SELECT] and tap [START] to start playback from the step your cursor
    is on. If already playing, play will jump to the cursor position at then
    end of the current step (thus keeping in time).

MUTE
  + Hold [SELECT] and tap [U/D/L/R] to mute/unmute A/B/C/D

SPEED
  + Hold [START] and tap [U/D] to change playback speed

SWING
  + Hold [START] and tap [L/R] to change swing

MOVE
  + [U/D/L/R] to move around

EDIT
  + Hold [B] and tap/hold [L/R] to change value by +/-1 or 
    tap/hold [U/D] to change value by +/-10 (16)

PAINT
  + Tap [B] to 'paint' last edited value

SELECTION
  + Hold [A] and tap [L/R] to set copy range from cursor position
    You can only select cells on the current row

CLEAR
  + Hold [A] and then tap [B] to clear a value *
  + To clear a selection:
    Hold [A] and tap [L/R] to define selection, while still holding
    [A], tap [B]

COPY
  + Hold [A] and tap [U] to copy current selection to copy buffer

PASTE
  + Hold [A] and tap [D] to paste copy buffer at current position

RANDOMISE
  + On any column other than CTRL:
    Hold [B] and tap [SELECT] to randomise row (except CTRL)
    Hold [A] and tap [SELECT] to randomise single value
  + On CTRL column:
    Hold [B] and tap [SELECT] to randomise repeat count (Rx)
    Hold [A] and tap [SELECT] to randomise next step (xN)
  + To randomise a selection:
    Hold [A] and tap [L/R] to define selection and while still holding
    [A], tap [SELECT]

The reason randomise is different for the CTRL column is so that you
don't inadvertently randomise the repeat/next step value which could
really mess up the flow of your pattern.

BONUS STAGE!

  Special FX

  + Hold [START] + [SELECT] then tap [U] to repeat the step that
    the cursor is on. You can keep increasing the tempo while the step is
    repeating by tapping/holding [U] and decreases the repeat tempo by
    tapping/holding [D]

  + Hold [START] + [SELECT] then tap/hold [L] to retard the synthesis
    engine temporarily. Tap/hold [R] to increase it again. Letting go
    of the buttons restores the synthesis speed

    The two effects can be combined.

    Letting go of [START]+[SELECT] restores the tempo and synthesis rate
    and also starts playback from the last step you forced playback from 
    (by holding [SELECT] and tapping [START] - see the 'PLAY' section 
    above). This way you can create your FX fill and have the pattern 
    start at the 'beginning' when you let go of the FX controls.
  

PARAMETER EXPLANATION

Voice A (Square) Parameters:
----------------------------

IPA: Initial Pitch for Square A
     00 - 7F = one shot (when sweeping pitch)
     80 - FF = looping (when sweeping pitch)

MDA: Pitch Mod Depth for Square A
     00 = no sweep
     01 to 7F = sweep down, slow to fast (*2)
     80 = no sweep
     FF to 81 = sweep up, slow to fast (*2)
     If in one-shot mode, sound will be cut off when upper/lower limit reached
     If in looping mode, sweep will be constantly cycled for duration of step

MSA: Pitch Sweep Speed for Square A
     00 = no sweep
     01 to FF = sweep speed, slowest to fastest

EVA: Amplitude and Decay for Square A
     00 = don't trigger envelope for this step
     xA = initial amplitude, 0 to F
     Dx = decay speed, 0 to F (slow to fast)

Voice B (Square) Parameters:
----------------------------

IPB: Initial note for Square B, operation same as for IPA
MDB: Pitch Sweep Depth for Square B, same as MDA
MSB: Pitch Sweep Speed for Square B, same as MSA
EVB: Amplitude and Decay for Square B, same as EVA

Voice C (Triangle) Parameters:
----------------------------

IPC: Initial note for Triangle
     00 = no note on this step*
     01 - 7F = one shot (when sweeping pitch)
     80 = no note on this step*
     81 - FF = looping (when sweeping pitch)

MDC: Pitch Sweep Depth for Triangle, same as MDA/MDB
MSC: Pitch Sweep Speed for Triangle, same as MSA/MSB

*Because the Triangle voice (C) has no volume control, specifying
no note (00) for IPC has a similar effect to specifying 00 for the
envelope (EVx) for the other voices.


Voice D (Noise) Parameters:
----------------------------

MDD: Pitch and modulation for Noise
     00-0F = normal clock pitch
     10-1F = slow clock pitch
     20-2F = normal clock pitch + 1 pitch toggle
     30-3F = slow clock pitch + 1 pitch toggle
     40-4F = normal clock pitch + 2 pitch toggle
     50-5F = slow clock pitch + 2 pitch toggle
     and so on...

EVD: Amplitude and Decay for Noise, same as EVA/EVB

CTRL: Step Control
      00 = play this step then move to next
      Sx = step repeat count
           1-F = repeat this step for that number of times
      xN = next step after this one, 0-F

"cajoNES DELUXE!"

In addition to the instructions for "cajoNES", the "DELUXE!" version has
several enhancements but requires an emulator or cartridge that supports
8K battery/save RAM

You'll need an emulator that supports battery RAM - I use Nestopia (OSX)

The ROM name is 'cajoNES+.nes'

"DELUXE!" features:

+ a menu to LOAD and SAVE patterns into 8 save slots
+ in the same menu you can CLEAR any of the 8 save slots
+ button combos for quick LOAD or SAVE of the current pattern
+ extra screen info relating to these functions

Saving a Pattern to a slot will save the Pattern step data, the
Pattern Speed, the Swing Amount, the channel Mute status and 
the Start Step.

SCREEN
  An exclamation mark (!) will appear next to the Pattern number if
  it has not been saved in it's current state.

LOAD
  To 'quick load' the current pattern, hold [B] and tap [START]

SAVE
  To 'quick save' the current pattern, hold [A] and tap [START]
  The screen will flash to indicate saving took place

LOAD/SAVE/CLEAR SLOT
  To access this sub-menu, hold tap [SELECT]
  In the menu:
    tap/hold [LEFT/RIGHT] to select the save slot
    tap/hold [UP/DOWN] to select the function
    tap [B] to cancel
    tap [A] to select the function
  
  When selecting a save slot, bright numbers already contain data while
  grey numbers are considered 'empty'
